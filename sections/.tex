\section{Conclusion}


This study mainly analyzes the use of GAN networks in object detection of malaria blood smears. This study uses a process consist of the following main steps: blood smears image acquisition, image generation with GANs networks; train a convolutional neural network;  apply adaptive  threshold in blood smears images and classify objects with the trained convolutional network. Six experiments where performed. The experiments showed that the images generated by the DGAN network can be used in the training of a CNN network to detect objects improving classifier accuracy. For future work we believe that investigating more sophisticated techniques for detecting objects such as Region Based CNN, will be beneficial. The objects detected by the presented process can be classified allowing a new malaria diagnosis approach.
