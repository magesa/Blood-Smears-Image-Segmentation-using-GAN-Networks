\section{Deep Learning for Malaria Diagnosis}

In this project, a preliminary systematic mapping of the state of the art was conducted based on the process described by Petersen et al. according to which, there are five essential steps to be followed: (i) definition of research questions, (ii) conducting research on relevant primary studies, (iii) document screening, (iv) keywording of abstracts, and (v) data extraction and mapping.

Premaratne et al. used digital images of oil immersion views from microscopic slides captured though a capture card. They were preprocessed by segmentation and grayscale conversion to reduce their dimensionality and later fed into a feed forward backpropagation neural network (NN) for training \cite{Premaratne2006AFilms}.
